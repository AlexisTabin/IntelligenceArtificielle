In	this	project,	we	will	develop	an	AI	system	that	helps	to	treat	people	who	might	
develop	heart	disease,	with	the	following	objectives:
1) Use	a	publicly	available	dataset	with	a	machine	learning	algorithm	(ID3)	to	
  obtain	a	model	for	predicting	if	someone	will	develop	heart	disease.
  
2) Test	the	accuracy	of	the	model	on	test	data.

3) Generate	rules	that	can	be	used	for	explaining	predictions	and	
recommendations.

4) Implement	a	tool	that	points	to	possible	treatments	to	avoid	heart	disease.

5) Improve	the	performance	of	the	learning	algorithm	and	propose	further	
improvements	to	the	process.
